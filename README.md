# Telebot JSX ðŸš¢

Highly experimental way to create Telegram Bots in JSX syntax.

## Usage

```sh
npm i telebot-jsx
```
BTW, It's a react app, so you'll need to compile it... I'll prefer using typescript... You may even use babel...

> You may check `tsconfig.json` on this project for reference...

For now,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PiyushSuthar/telebot-jsx.git

cd telebot-jsx

yarn # Install deps
yarn test # Run example file
```

Don't forget to add `TOKEN` in `.env` file,

Look `example` folder for example app.
